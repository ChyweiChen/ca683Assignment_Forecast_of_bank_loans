# ca683Assignment_Forecast_of_bank_loans
Our topic is to explore whether this loan is for high or low risk. The data we used was a large and rich dataset from the US Small Business Administration (SBA). Default rates on SBA loans have been a much debated topic in the US, as the SBA issues loans to customers through individual banks, and if the customer defaults then the bank suffers a loss. This database that we use contains 27 columns with over 800,000 data. We will use data mining techniques to analyse the data and build a model to predict whether the loan is a high risk loan, which will provide a good decision on whether the bank should reject or agree to a loan change, thus reducing the bank's losses.
